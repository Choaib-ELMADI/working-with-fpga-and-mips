## TP 1 - Introduction to NIOS II and Embedded Programming

In this first session, we focused on:

- **Part a)** Displaying moving patterns on 7-segment displays using assembly
- **Part b)** Writing a C program to find the largest number in a list and store it in memory
- **Part c)** Counting the number of 1s in a 32-bit word and store the result in memory

The exercises included setting up the development environment and implementing a MIPS-based system.
