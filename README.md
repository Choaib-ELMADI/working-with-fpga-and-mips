# Working with FPGA and MIPS

This repository contains my hands-on work and practical sessions (TPs) focusing on FPGA programming and MIPS-based systems. Using the ALTERA Cyclone V SoC DE-1 SoC board, I explore various embedded system applications.

These sessions include tasks such as assembly and C programming for embedded systems, system design using Intel Monitor Program, and working with NIOS II processors. The repository will be continuously updated with new sessions and implementations.
