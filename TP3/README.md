## TP 3 - Introduction to Intel Platform Designer

In this session, we explored the Intel Platform Designer tool to design, simulate, and implement a simple hardware system using Quartus.

- **Part a)** Designing and simulating the system in Quartus, including configuring components like Nios II processors, memory, ...
- **Part b)** Implementing and testing the system on the ALTERA Cyclone V SoC DE-1 board

This session provided hands-on experience in creating hardware systems and integrating them into an FPGA-based design.
