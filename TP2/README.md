## TP 2 - Input and Output Peripherals Using NIOS II Interruptions

In this second session, we focused on:

- **Part a)** Displaying numbers on the 7-segment displays based on user key presses
- **Part b)** Building a counter triggered by a key press
- **Part c)** Flashing a single LED on and off

All implementations were based on interruptions, focusing on managing input/output peripherals and interacting with the hardware.
